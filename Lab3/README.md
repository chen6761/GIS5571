# I use two different network datasets to find the best route for two vehicles to visit 10 stops. One network dataset is created by Esri, and the other one is built by myself. To meet the requirement of the instructor, I need to set the arrival times and avoid highway constructions. In the end, I discuss the difference between the two results and find how complicated to make a network dataset.
