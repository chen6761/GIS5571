# Part1
#First, I downloaded the .las files from Minnesota DNR¡¦s FTP server, converted them into DEM and TIN, and exported them into PDFs. Second, I also made a 2D and 3D visualization of .las files in ArcPro to learn how to use the features to work on it. Last, I downloaded the data from PRISM, converted the data into a spacetime cube, and make an animation of the result with arcpy.

#Part2
#I used the distance tool under the spatial analyst tools to figure an optimal that meets Dory¡¦s different reference. I also took terrain, water, and road as consideration and improved the result. The report includes all the tools I executed and the steps I took.
